# PR: feature/s3-direct-writes → main

## Summary

Refactor the pipeline to write all outputs (bronze, silver, gold, control plane, run log) directly to S3 via DuckDB `httpfs` and `boto3`. Removes the local EBS data volume as a durable storage layer and eliminates the post-run `aws s3 sync` step from the GitHub Actions workflow.

**Branch:** `feature/s3-direct-writes`  
**Date:** 2026-05-08  
**Validated via:** GitHub Actions runs `25540595793` (historical) and `25540903789` (incremental) — both passing.

## What Changed and Why

### New File — `pipeline/s3_utils.py`
Central S3 utility module. All other files import from here.
- `configure_duckdb_s3(conn)` — fetches credentials from boto3's chain (env vars → IAM instance profile) and injects via DuckDB `SET` commands. DuckDB 0.10.0 `httpfs` does not auto-resolve EC2 IMDS inside Docker — explicit injection is required.
- `s3_key_exists(bucket, key)` — boto3 `head_object` check; replaces `os.path.exists`.
- `atomic_parquet_put(bucket, key, df)` — serializes `pd.DataFrame` or `pa.Table` to parquet bytes in memory and writes via a single `boto3.put_object`. Preserves INV-40 atomicity.
- `parse_s3_uri(uri)` — splits `s3://bucket/key` into `(bucket, key)`.

### `pipeline/pipeline.py`
- All local path constants changed to `s3://` URIs.
- `initialise_control_plane(data_dir)` → `initialise_control_plane(s3_bucket)`.
- All `os.makedirs` and `os.path.exists` calls removed.
- `configure_duckdb_s3(conn)` added to every `duckdb.connect()` block.
- Silver and gold placeholder parquets rewritten using `pa.table()` with explicit pyarrow types (`pa.date32()` for date columns). Previously `pd.Series(dtype='object')` was used — this writes `string` type to parquet and caused UNION ALL type mismatches with `DATE` columns from bronze data.
- Stale-empty placeholder check: if a placeholder exists with 0 rows (left by a prior failed run), recreate it with correct types.

### `pipeline/run_log.py`
- `flush()`: guard added for non-S3 paths (fallback JSONL writes locally without calling `parse_s3_uri`). `"404"` added to the "file not found" exception check — DuckDB httpfs raises `"404 (Not Found)"` for missing S3 files, not `"No files found"`.
- `check_unlogged_run()`: same `"404"` check added for both `control.parquet` and `run_log.parquet` reads.

### `pipeline/control_plane.py`
- All local file paths → S3 URIs.
- `configure_duckdb_s3` added to all DuckDB connections.
- `os.replace` (temp-file atomic rename) replaced with `atomic_parquet_put` for all control-plane writes.

### Bronze Loaders (`bronze_accounts.py`, `bronze_transactions.py`, `bronze_transaction_codes.py`)
- `COPY ... TO 's3://...'` writes directly — no temp file, no local mkdir.
- `s3_key_exists` replaces `os.path.exists` for the idempotency gate.
- `configure_duckdb_s3` added to every DuckDB connection.

### `pipeline/dbt_runner.py`
- `s3_bucket` added to `default_vars` in `derive_execution_order()`.
- Improved JSON log streaming — all dbt events printed; stderr merged with stdout.

### `dbt/profiles.yml`
- `s3_access_key_id`, `s3_secret_access_key`, `s3_session_token` added via `env_var()` in the settings block. dbt runs its own DuckDB sessions — credentials must be injected through the profile.

### dbt SQL Models (5 files)
All paths changed from `/app/data/...` to `s3://{{ var("s3_bucket") }}/...` in source reads and post_hook COPY targets.

`silver_accounts.sql` and `gold_weekly_account_summary.sql`: removed `run_query(glob(...))` compile-time file-exists checks — these ran at compile time, failed silently, and had no error visibility. Replaced with `{% set file_exists = true %}` — `pipeline.py` guarantees placeholder existence before dbt runs.

### `docker-compose.yml`
- `network_mode: host` — container shares host network to reach EC2 IMDS at `169.254.169.254`.
- `S3_BUCKET` and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` added to environment.

### `requirements.txt`
- `boto3>=1.34.0`, `pyarrow>=14.0.0` added.

### `.env.example`
- `S3_BUCKET`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` present. AWS credential vars removed — credentials are resolved at runtime via EC2 instance role, not `.env`.

### `.github/workflows/run-pipeline.yml`
- "Ensure .env exists on EC2" always overwrites from `.env.example` (previously only on missing file — stale expired credentials would persist across runs).
- "Inject AWS credentials into .env" step **removed** — credentials flow: boto3 IMDS → DuckDB + `os.environ` → dbt subprocess.
- `docker builder prune -f` added before every Docker build — prevents BuildKit cache corruption on long-running instances.
- "Sync data to S3" step **removed** — data is written to S3 directly during the run.
- "Verify pipeline outputs" step updated — queries S3 paths.

### `Infra-AWS/cf-cc-transactions-lake.yaml`
- `MetadataOptions: HttpPutResponseHopLimit: 2, HttpTokens: required, HttpEndpoint: enabled` added to EC2 instance — Docker bridge adds one extra network hop; default hop limit of 1 blocks IMDS access from inside containers.

## Invariants

| Invariant | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| INV-40 (atomicity) | ✅ S3 `PutObject` is atomic; `atomic_parquet_put` serializes in memory before upload |
| INV-01 (source immutability) | ✅ `source/` unchanged; no write operations target `/app/source` |
| INV-19 (run log append-only) | ✅ `flush()` reads existing rows then writes combined set via `atomic_parquet_put` |
| INV-14 (weekly gate) | ✅ Gold weekly computed only when `week_end_date <= processed_date` |

## Problems Fixed During Validation (12 total)

| # | Problem | Fix |
|---|---------|-----|
| 1 | HTTP 403 — DuckDB httpfs doesn't resolve IMDS in Docker | `configure_duckdb_s3()` + `profiles.yml` settings + IMDS step in workflow |
| 2 | `.env not found` during Docker build | Moved "Ensure .env" before "Rebuild Docker image" in workflow |
| 3 | `FATAL: Not an S3 URI` — fallback path passed to `parse_s3_uri` | Non-S3 path guard in `flush()` |
| 4 | `silver_accounts` UNION ALL type mismatch | `pa.date32()` for date columns in placeholder |
| 5 | Stale placeholder not recreated on retry | Row count check — recreate if 0 rows |
| 6 | `run_log.parquet` HTTP 404 not caught in `flush()` | `"404" in str(e)` added to exception check |
| 7 | `run_log.parquet` HTTP 404 not caught in `check_unlogged_run()` | Same fix, second code path |
| 8 | `gold_weekly` UNION ALL type mismatch | Same `pa.date32()` fix + stale check |
| 9 | `400 Bad Request` on S3 HeadObject — stale expired credentials in `.env` | Always overwrite `.env` from `.env.example` on each run |
| 10 | HTTP 403 on DuckDB httpfs after removing `.env` credential injection | Restored boto3→DuckDB credential injection; DuckDB 0.10.0 does not auto-resolve IMDS |
| 11 | dbt subprocess had no S3 credentials — `silver_transaction_codes` ERROR | `configure_duckdb_s3()` now exports credentials to `os.environ`; dbt inherits via `env_var()` |
| 12 | Docker build exit code 17 — BuildKit snapshot corruption | `docker builder prune -f` before every build |
